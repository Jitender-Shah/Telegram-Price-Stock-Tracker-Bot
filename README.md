# Telegram Price & Stock Tracker Bot

A versatile Telegram bot that monitors product prices and stock availability on Shopify-based e-commerce sites. Users can track products, set a target price, and receive instant notifications for price drops and restocks.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Price Tracking**: Set a target price for a product and get an alert when the price drops to or below your target.
- **Stock Monitoring**: Get notified as soon as an "Out of Stock" item becomes available again.
- **Simple Commands**: Easy-to-use commands (`/track`, `/list`, `/untrack`) for managing your tracked items.
- **Persistent Data**: The bot remembers your tracked items even if it restarts.
- **Reliable Scraping**: Uses a fast and stable JSON endpoint method to fetch product data, avoiding issues with bot detection.
- **24/7 Monitoring**: Designed to be deployed on a cloud server for continuous, around-the-clock tracking.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The bot leverages the `.json` endpoints available on Shopify-powered websites. Instead of "hard scraping" the HTML of a product page (which is slow and often blocked), the bot makes a direct request to a URL like `.../product-name.json`.

This returns a clean JSON object containing all product variant information, including price and availability, making the data retrieval process fast, efficient, and reliable.
